Main tasks: Make a portfolio site about yourself, your interest, and your experience(with examples) 
+
   - site code must be on the your github repo, with clear commits(not the big commit in the end) 
-
   - site will have minimum of three html pages(connected trough header links) 
+
   - site must have header(static, follows the scrolling of the page, also in header there must be an option to go to diff pages)
+ 
   - site must have a footer - Sticky footer(also follows the scrolling of the page and it's scalling properly)
+ 
   - all pages must have the same header and footer, where header is highlighting on what page you are(making link bolder or something)
+  
   - along side using custom css, you must use bootstrap for most of the stuff, especially grids
+
   - no serbian
+  
   - make sure that site is resposive on all relevant browsers and screens(you can skip interner explorer compatibility)

Other/Bonus: 
   - use as less css as possible(do not compromise stability, everything needs to work)
   - use css for animation(no jquery)
   - use jquery in same places like opening a dropdown menus
   - use some kind of carousel(only if using jquery)
   - extra bonus and points for good UX/UI 
   - finish everything before deadline, including the bonus stuff(bonus will scale with time left)

Deadline - for Main tasks deadline is three days(24h), for other/bonus stuff is 8h
   for the resurses you received from me and that you can online easily find is more than enough time to finish all
